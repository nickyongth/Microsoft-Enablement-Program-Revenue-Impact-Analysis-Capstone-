# Microsoft Enablement Program Revenue Impact Analysis Capstone 

## Project Overview

In my capstone project with Microsoft, my team explored the impact of enablement programs on revenue generation, specifically focusing on how targeted role-based training influences product consumption and overall business performance. Utilizing data analytics tools such as SQL and Python, we analyzed extensive datasets from Microsoft Learning & Revenue to uncover insights and optimize training strategies. This analysis provided actionable recommendations to enhance Microsoft's upskilling initiatives and drive significant revenue growth.
